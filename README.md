## Hi, I'm Clark 👋
> They/Any

I'm a third-year student studying **mechatronics engineering** ⚙ at UBC. I'm particularly interested in controls, and more generally the intersection of mathematics and mechatronic design.

Check out my custom-made [**portfolio website**](https://cjeffreybda.github.io/) for a collection of my past projects!

#### I'm currently working on:
- 🤿 an **autonomous underwater vehicle** with [UBC Subbots](https://www.subbots.ca/#/)
- 📊 a **buoyancy analysis program** for Onshape assemblies, using JavaScript and Onshape's REST API.

#### I'm learning about:
- 🔄 quaternions
- 🌐 API interfacing
- 🧵 asynchronous functions and multithreading
- 🖥 desktop app development.
